## To compile: 
ant -buildfile src/build.xml all

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To run by specifying arguments from command line 
## We will use this to run your code

"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.‚Äù

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

LinkedHashMap - I have used LinkedHashMap to store Courses because it maintains order, as well as
it can handle key value pair, which makes it better than other data structure.
Time Complexity for operations in LinkedHashMap is O(1).

Vector - I have used vector because it is synchronized data structure, it can store null values, and it is easy to increase the size of vector as it doubles the size by default.
Time Complexity for Operations in O(1).

Provide list of citations (urls, etc.) from where you have taken code
(if any).

I have made getNextAvailableCourse in course class static, as it solves the complexity of code.
